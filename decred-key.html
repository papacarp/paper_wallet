<h3>Decred Javascript Paper Wallet test</h3>
<p>This will process through the difficult aspect of the math related to creating addresses and keys to confirm functionality.  At present it utilizes two different crypto libraries plus a third very old version of one of them.  It is meant to be a proof of concept only.</p>
<p>Functionality Required and implemented:
<ul>
    <li>SHA512</li>
    <li>ECC: secp256k1</li>
    <li>Blake256</li>
    <li>Ripemd160</li>
</ul>

Check console output for results.
